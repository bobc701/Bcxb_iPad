Updated for reading on-line team data.
Search: --1909.01

7/7'19
This is prodection version just prior to making changes to the on-line
team retrieval.
This does not work, because I already made changes to BcxbLib_SAP (for BcxbXf).

Working pretty good.
Who has 11 elts, PosLim returns 9 or 10 dep on UsingDh.
Got rid of whoDh.
Hiding labels on field diagram at start of game.
Release candidate?

3/19'19
Still in middle of overhauling lineup card logic.
I am about to start changing who to length 11 (so DH is 10). (This saved as _Bkp1)

3/14'19
Still in middle of overhauling lineup card logic.
I am about to limit Available list to all, pitchers, or non-pitchers.
Also will change who to [11] (ie, 0..10 i/o 0..9).

3/12'19
The throws have been relocated to the high level, ie, CLineupCardController.

3/4'19
This version is mid-changes to the line up card.
This has throw's in low level (CLineupCard.ReplacePlayer() and AssignPos())
but I need to have the exception logic at high level instead, works
better, LineupCardController - cmdDoIt.TUI.

I implimented a button on the About page to launch Safari with zeemerix.com.
Next: Organize the About page as both About and Help.

1/22'19
I added tan color to the menu buttons, and implimented the About screen.

1/22'19
I enhanced the launch screen with color, rounded corners, etc.
Next up: Experiment with colors in main menu buttons, add About screen.

_b2 1/15'19...
This is working with all the constraints coded, tested on simulator for iPad 9.7, 10.5, and 12.1.
Also, code to position disk1 on the main screen, based on View.Center.X & .Y
Fixed so 'Drill down' not eneabled on 'Start'.
Changed pitcher box column label to be "hr" i/o "so"
Box score grids need a little more size tweeking.
Need to test on device.

#1812.01
Fixed problem of out balls not appearing. Solution involves adding
new image sets under the asset catalog "Images" (which already existed).
I called the new image sets RedBall and WhtBall. The to assign the red ball
or the white ball to the UIImage controll's Image property, you do:
   lblOuts1.Image = mGame.ok > 0 ? UIImage.FromBundle("RedBall") : UIImage.FromBundle("WhtBall");

#1706.27
Fixed the problem with fielding wheel not displaying labels.
As byproduct of the fix, wedge ladels now appear on the fielding wheel.
Changed 'Details' button to 'Drill Down'.
Some changes in BcxbLib for this.
(This is documented in EverNote. See #1706.27a/b.)


#1706.23
Got linescore working for extra innings.
-- Inning numbers above innings
-- Left & right shift buttons if innings > 12.
-- Etc. (I believe all changes are on the UI side, in ViewController.cs.)


11/22-16
I made the changes needed to support the new CTeam. This is 
a 2-elt array of CTeam, in CGame.
I minimally tested it w/ iPhone simulator for Windows -- it runs!


Note: See 'Bcxb feature tags' in OneNote.


#1604.03
I moved Voice.Speak into the new results loop.

2016-04-29:
Now I have done the unification.
Project conditional compilation symbols include "IOS", which is applied to BcxbLib_SAP as well.
I made changes for 1604.02, box score updates from a List<>.

2016-04-29:
This is just before unification with the common BcxbLib_SAP, which has been 
modified for #1604.02, box score updates uning List of objects. 
So before the unified project can be used, must modify for that.


2015-12-07:
Have worked around programmatic unwind segue, and now have implemented 
and tested pinch hitting (#1512.01), have done code for pinch running, but not debugged/tested
yet.

2015-12-02:
In middle of revising LineupCard & Available screens so that Alert is not used,
Rather the description of the action is posted on a label and user clicks DoIt!, which
does the adjustments then calls the unwind segue.

2015-11-24:
Have decided that lineupCard object needs to be moved back from CLineupcardSource back
into LineupCardController, because it's not just the UITableView that needs it -- the 
buttons for pinch hit, etc., need it too.
BUT HAVE NOT DONE IT YET.

#1510.01 -- Play-by-play in a queue
To get around sequencing of events, I modified to put play-by-play in a List<string> 
and play it back all at once.
